LegalDesk One‑Page Summary

Mission
Deliver a lean, offline‑ready matter management solution for small legal practices, consolidating client, case, task, time, expense, and invoice workflows.

Value Proposition
Simplifies administrative overhead, improves billing accuracy, enhances visibility into workload, and prepares a foundation for future multi‑device synchronization.

Core Modules
• Clients: Capture and maintain stakeholder profiles.  
• Cases: Organize legal matters and aggregate related activities.  
• Tasks: Manage actionable work with scheduling.  
• Billing: Combine TimeEntries, Expenses, and Invoices for financial oversight.  
• Calendar: Visualize deadlines and workload distribution.  
• About / Splash / Login: Orientation, startup, and future authentication.

Primary Entities
Client, Case, Task, TimeEntry, Expense, Invoice, User.

Key Features
Local persistence, PDF invoice creation, document scanning, optional ads, theme duality (light/dark), modular architecture.

Integrations
Firebase (future auth), Google Mobile Ads, Google Sign‑In (expansion), printing utilities, connectivity monitoring, document/image handling.

Strengths
• Offline reliability  
• Extensible modular design  
• Focused domain scope  
• Clear data relationships

Current Limitations
Limited automated tests, no encryption, no sync, minimal authentication, basic error handling.

Roadmap Snapshot
Authentication hardening, cloud synchronization, advanced reporting, encryption at rest, responsive desktop/web layout, notification scheduling.

Security Outlook
Local storage only; encryption and role controls planned. Permissions must be transparently managed.

Performance Outlook
Hive enables efficient local operations; scaling strategies (pagination, indexing) will mitigate large data growth risks.

Contribution Guidelines (Condensed)
Adopt feature branches, emphasize incremental test coverage, attach rationale to architectural changes, and document user impact in proposals.

Success Metrics (Prospective)
User retention, reduction in administrative overhead, invoice accuracy, performance consistency under data growth.

Strategic Differentiators
Simplicity, offline default, domain specificity, and ready pathway to synchronization without existing complexity burdens.

Summary
LegalDesk establishes a solid foundation for practical legal operations while leaving space for measured, security‑aware expansion and richer collaboration features.
